					RULES FOR ALLOTMENT:
				</h1>
				<ol class="content">
					<li>
						The hostel allocation process takes place in stages for various years thus the options will appear accordingly to the phases.
						As for example the first phase was registration so only edit information and fill info tab was there, in the next phase of 
						hostel allocation other tabs would be highlighted accordingly.
						<br>
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Now suppose you are eligible for singlet, doublet and triplets. The allocation process will start with singlet first then 
						doublets and triplets.Now the students who desire singlet will fill their choices first. 
						For example consider 50 singlet rooms, 25 doublet and 50 triplets and 500 students applying for it, the top 50 will be allotted
						the singlet and rest of the students will participate further for doublets and triplets.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="footnote">
							Note: Whether you are a high ranker or low ranker you will only be allotted rooms if you fill choices otherwise you will be 
							allotted randomly in the last phase.
						</span>
						<br>
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						For doublets and triplets (or rooms with more than 1 person capacity) a grouping scheme called 'Roommate Finder' is there and 
						after grouping for doublets, choice filling will take place for doublets and after room allotment occurs then again grouping 
						will be done by roommate finder for triplets and the choice filling for triplets will take place.
						<br>
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Roommate Finder: <br>
						For doublet and triplets students will make groups according to capacity of the rooms for example for a doublet room a group 
						of 2 students, for a triplet a group of 3 students. For making groups you will send and receive requests from other fellow 
						students for grouping purpose.
						Now after a group is formed all the students in the group can participate in room choice filling but further sending and
						receiving requests in case of triplets will be handled by leader(one with higher pointer).
						<br>
						For example for a triplet if a group of 2 has been formed the one with higher pointer will handle further request.
						<br>

						2. Roommate Finder Stage I:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTXMNJ-X3uA">www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTXMNJ-X3uA</a><br>

						<br><br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Choice Filling:<br>
						Now the leader of the group will be responsible for filling room choices for the group. For example the 25 doublets will be
						filled first and then again grouping for triplets will be done as per roommate finder and then the 50 triplets will be filled.

				Algorithm for Allotment:<br>
				</h1>
				<ol class="content">
					<li style="font:normal bold 15px sans-serif;">
						Rank for Hostel Allocation:<br>
						This will explain how we are calculating the ranks for hostel allocation.<br><br>
						<ul style="font:normal normal 15px sans-serif">
							<li>
								Firstly every student of every branch is being scaled on a scale of 0 to 10 within their branch based on strength of the branch and
								their respective ranks.<br>
								For example we assign 10 to branch topper and 0 to lowest rank then scale all the other students between 0 and 10 by a difference 
								calculated by dividing class strength by 10.<br><br>
							</li>
							<li>
								After this process is completed for all the branches we have got all the students assigned with a number between 0 and 10, thus 
								using this we combine and sort all the students in one unified list based on the number assigned to each student.<br><br>
							</li>
							<li>
								Now for students sharing the same number we sort them by their CGPI.<br><br>
							</li>
							<li>
								Now using this unified list we allot various hostels, priority being given to higher ranks.<br><br>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<br>
					</li>
					<li style="font:normal bold 15px sans-serif;">
						Grouping for Hostel Allocation:<br>
						<ul style="font:normal normal 15px sans-serif">
							<li>
								Grouping has to be done for allotment of doublets, triplets and pent lets. For this we introduce 'Roommate Finder' 
								application by which students are expected to form group according to the capacity of the rooms being allocated.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<div class="footnote">
					IMPORTANT: This entire project is an undertaking of Department of Computer Science and Engineering and Department of Architecture 
					and first of its kind where we aim to automate the entire hostel allocation process for convenience of both students and staff. 
					This project is very strict for its timeline for grouping and room choice filling and once time for a particular phase has passed 
					it cannot be repeated so please be aware about the procedure and spread the word as we do not want any student to miss.
