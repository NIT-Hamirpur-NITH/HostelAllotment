						<div class="question">Question:</div>
							 What if I forget to fill choices on time?
						<br>
						<div class="answer">Answer:</div>
							This year choice filling will occur in phases i.e firstly for singlets then doublets and then triplets thus filling choice 
							is necessary for all the students if they wish to participate in hostel allocation if how so ever you forget to or skip 
							filling choices in any phase then you would not be allotted any room in that phase and you would be eligible to participate
							again in next phase.If you do not fill choices even in last phase you would be randomly allotted in that phase.

							 What if I fill about 20 choices and do not get any room due to my low rank ?
						<div class="answer">Answer:</div>
							 The hostel allocation will first take place for singlet then doublets and then triplets, if you have filled 20 choices 
							 during singlet phase but did not get a room of choice then if a room remains then you will be allotted it otherwise you 
							 have to form groups for doublets and submit choices and if still not allotted then you repeat for triplets phase.
